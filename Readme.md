## PHP-FPM Image for running Laravel applications

This is a docker image with PHP 7, some commonly used PHP extensions including gd, opcache, and composer installed. It can be used for any PHP project but I have built it for my [Laravel](http://laravel.com) development stack. 
As this image is built on top of the [php-fpm-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) image, it is just ~93 MB in size.

For more usage visit official [PHP](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) docker hub.
